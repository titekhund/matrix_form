Welcome to the Matrix of Data, a realm where choices define reality, akin to the pivotal decision between the blue and red pills in 'The Matrix'. Opting for the blue pill is like running regression through a statistical program – a path of convenience and surface understanding. But today, we choose the red pill, delving into the intricacies of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression in matrix form. This choice, embodied in our replication of the example from Annex C of the G&P textbook[^1] using R, takes us on a transformative journey. It reveals the inner mechanics of the statistical system, akin to understanding the underlying code of the Matrix. 

## Dataset

Our canvas for this statistical artistry is a dataset from the "Economic Report of the President, January 1972, Table B-16." Compact yet rich, this dataset is the perfect medium for our exploration, allowing us to maneuver through the nuances of matrix manipulations with ease. 

**Variable Definitions:**
- PER CAPITA PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE (PPCE)
- PER CAPITA PERSONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME (PPDI) in the United States, 1956–1970

**Time Period Encoding:** 1 corresponds to the year 1956 (1 = 1956).
